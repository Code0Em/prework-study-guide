        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) gives the content structure</li>
          <li>Head element contains information (or metadata) about the webpage</li>
          <li>Body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>Metadata is used by the browser to serve our webpage and is not typically seen by users</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements describe their content and the role they play on a webpage (e.g. body element is an example of this)</li>
          <li>Child elements are elements nested inside other elements; whereas a parent element is the element that holds all the children</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element (from opening tag to closing tag); whereas a tag only refers to what appears inside the < brackets</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) define how the content is presented to users (e.g. colours, aesthetics, visual layout, organisation)</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS (inline, internal and external)</li>
          <li>External CSS is the most common because it allows developers to keep CSS rules in a separate file</li>
          <li>When we create an external CSS file, we need to link it to the HTML file using the HTML link element</li>
          <li>CSS rules are made up of a selector and declaration block</li>
          <li>We can use HTML elements as selectors (e.g. img) or class attributes (e.g. .card); class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule with more than one element (i.e. we can define a class attribute that applies to multiple elements)</li>
          <li>Examples of CSS selectors include * (applies rule to all visible elements on the page), img (to any image element), ul (to any list element) and p (to any text)</li>
          <li>Declarations contain the property (e.g. color) and the value of the property (e.g. blue)</li>
          <li>Examples of CSS properties include:</li>
          <li>margin (indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element)</li>
          <li>padding (indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element)</li>
          <li>text-align (specifies the horizontal alignment of text in an element; e.g. center)</li>
          <li>font-size (sets the size of the font)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add: adds a change in the working branch to the staging area</li>
          <li>-A: indicates that we want to add all changes</li>
          <li>git commit -m "message": commits and includes a message that describes what the commit contains (e.g. "add starter code": we're adding our starter code)</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: checks that are local default branch (i.e. main branch) is in sync with our remote default branch</li>
          <li>git push origin branch-name: pushes our local changes to our remote branch (i.e. changes made in <i>local</i> branch-name to remote branch-name)</li>

        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) allows users to interact with websites</li>
          <li>We link the JS file to the HTML file using the HTML link element within the body element (whereas a CSS file is linked within head element)</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script; JS files are read from top to bottom</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code (e.g. a variable called shape holds a circle)</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data (e.g. a variable called shapes holds four different shapes: a triangle, square, pentagon, and circle)</li>
          <li>A single array can store different types of data (e.g. strings, numbers, etc)</li>
          <li>Strings are for storing and manipulating text, and are surrounded by quotation marks (e.g. "HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript")</li>
          <li>To work with an individual data item inside an array, we need the location of the data item in the array (i.e. the index)</li>
          <li>JS arrays are zero-indexed and sequential (i.e. start with 0 and are whole numbers that increase by 1 each time)</li>
          <li>Loops are used to perform repeated tasks based on a condition (e.g. a for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false)</li>
          <li>A for loop consists of: the keyword "for", a three-part conditional statement, and a code block (inside curly brackets)</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into code (e.g. computer checks to see if condition is truthy; if it is, it will action code block; if it isn’t, it will ignore code block and move on)</li>
          <li>We can use loops and conditional statements to control the order in which code is executed (i.e. interrupt the control flow)</li>
          <li>A function is set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
          <li>We must call a function by name in order to execute it (i.e. unlike loops and conditional statements, functions don't automatically execute when the JS file is run)</li>
