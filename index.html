        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) gives the content structure</li>
          <li>Head element contains information (or metadata) about the webpage</li>
          <li>Body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>Metadata is used by the browser to serve our webpage and is not typically seen by users</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements describe their content and the role they play on a webpage (e.g. body element is an example of this)</li>
          <li>Child elements are elements nested inside other elements; whereas a parent element is the element that holds all the children</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element (from opening tag to closing tag); whereas a tag only refers to what appears inside the < brackets</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) define how the content is presented to users (e.g. colours, aesthetics, visual layout, organisation)</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS (inline, internal and external)</li>
          <li>External CSS is the most common because it allows developers to keep CSS rules in a separate file</li>
          <li>When we create an external CSS file, we need to link it to the HTML file using the HTML link element</li>
          <li>CSS rules are made up of a selector and declaration block</li>
          <li>We can use HTML elements as selectors (e.g. img) or class attributes (e.g. .card); class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule with more than one element (i.e. we can define a class attribute that applies to multiple elements)</li>
          <li>Examples of CSS selectors include * (applies rule to all visible elements on the page), img (to any image element), ul (to any list element) and p (to any text)</li>
          <li>Declarations contain the property (e.g. color) and the value of the property (e.g. blue)</li>
          <li>Examples of CSS properties include:</li>
          <li>margin (indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element)</li>
          <li>padding (indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element)</li>
          <li>text-align (specifies the horizontal alignment of text in an element; e.g. center)</li>
          <li>font-size (sets the size of the font)</li>
        </ul>

          <li>git add: adds a change in the working branch to the staging area</li>
          <li>-A: indicates that we want to add all changes</li>
          <li>git commit -m "message": commits and includes a message that describes what the commit contains (e.g. "add starter code": we're adding our starter code)</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: checks that are local default branch (i.e. main branch) is in sync with our remote default branch</li>
          <li>git push origin branch-name: pushes our local changes to our remote branch (i.e. changes made in <i>local</i> branch-name to remote branch-name)</li>
