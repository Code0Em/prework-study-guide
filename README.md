# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide contains learning points on HTML, CSS, GIT and Javascript. It was created by a Bootcamp student, to organise their notes and refer back to.

By creating the Study Guide, the Bootcamp student was introduced to key concepts in all four subject areas and was able to put their learning into immediate practice.

The Study Guide provides users with key information about HTML, CSS, GIT and Javascript, as well as a tool for deciding which area to study first.

The Console panel will open to the side or the bottom of the web browser and will display a list of the subject areas with a suggestion of which to subject study first.
